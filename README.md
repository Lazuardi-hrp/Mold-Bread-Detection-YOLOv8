The method used in this study involves taking microscopic images of the surface of bread that has been contaminated with mold. These images were then analyzed using custom-developed computer image processing software. After training the data and also matching the YOLOv8 model, we obtained results for precission 90.80%, recall 96.60% and average precision (AP) 97.40%.

This research has the potential to enhance the safety of white bread products and decrease health risks for consumers. Moreover, this method can be applied to the broader food industry for quick and precise detection of issues.
